+ Project summary: This project evaluates two fairness-aware machine learning algorithms: the Fairness-Aware Classifier with Prejudice Remover Regularizer and the algorithm from "Fairness Beyond Disparate Treatment & Disparate Impact: Learning Classification without Disparate Mistreatment." Using the COMPAS dataset, the performance and computational efficiency of each algorithm are analyzed and compared. The study focuses on key metrics including accuracy, fairness, and resource utilization to determine the strengths and limitations of each approach in handling biases in predictive modeling.
	
**Contribution statement**: Xiaoyu Mai constructs the code of first algorithm: Fairness Beyond Disparate Treatment & Disparate Impact, also contributing in writing part of the final report
